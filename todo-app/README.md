# TODO React / Entity Framework App

This is a small sample/test project using a react frontend and entity framework backend with the database housed in memory on the start up the backend (for now).

This is a small pet project for myself to play around with both frameworks coming from an almost strictly Angular background.

## Add TODO's ðŸ“ƒ!

Add users and add TODOs for them! This app is super basic and just highlights model relationships and CRUD operations. Nothing else fancy, it was purely made as a way to get an easy understanding of the frameworks.

## React Playground

I've never really coded in react (like I said Angular background) so most of what I've done is from coding principles I've developed in Angular, reading of current documentation, and my own intuition. Without formal training in it this is my best guess for how it should look so don't judge too harshly. ðŸ˜Š

## UI Elements

What react and angular DO have in common is that regardless of knowing either you probably should know css. Everything built in this app is done from scratch by me (icon's I definitely imported I'm not that good). Working in the frontend for so long I have a decent eye for UI/UX design, I'm definitely not one for maybe a "big picture" but if you show me a wireframe I can get it done.
